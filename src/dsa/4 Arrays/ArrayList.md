# ArrayList
Basically a normal array where you have the list of values, but you have a capacity that exceeds the current length of the supposed array.
- So you can push elements onto the array until it reaches the capacity
- Then a new array can be established with a larger capacity else where in memory and then copy the values from the initial array
- This is essentiall what an arrayList does under the hood.

So how I need to think about this data structures is the tradeoffs of using one over the other and what scenarios or nature of my input would affect these structures
