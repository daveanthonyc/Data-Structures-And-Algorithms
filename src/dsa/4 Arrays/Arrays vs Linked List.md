# Arrays vs Linked List
Array: has constant time usabillity of accessing index
- there is no insert method, but only write methods, meaning have to iterate through array to insert
- Requires upfront allocation of memory
    * Differs from linkedlist where there is not set limitation of memory, allowing for adding and deltion to be easier in linked list
    * Random access easier in Array because of the contant time operation of accessing index
    * But push pop in linked list is constant time and no limitations with memory allocation

- So we see that an array is great at random access but not good at growing due to the fixed memory allocation

##### Then what if I want the benefits of both?
